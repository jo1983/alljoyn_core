ALLJOYN-2098: Rejected AllJoyn daemon connect attempts are not properly

Known Issues
------------

ALLJOYN-1967: AllJoyn daemon cannot (quickly) detect disconnection of non-local
client connection such as thin-client connection

ALLJOYN-1973: AllJoyn does not support latest version of Android NDK. Last 
officially supported version of NDK is 8C.

ALLJOYN-2192: AllJoyn thin client does not support header compression.

ALLJOYN-2340: local bbclient fails to join multipoint session after two
remote clients join

ALLJOYN-2349: PINX authentication does not work between nodes of different
endianness

ALLJOYN-2374: AllJoyn thin client binding cannot send/receive messages larger
than 55KB

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: JavaScript and Win8/RT language bindings do not currently
support the new object based security APIs. These include JavaScript, Win8/RT 

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: JavaScript, Win8/RT, C and Unity bindings do not currently 
support new API changes to report reason for lost session

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: JavaScript, Win8/RT, C and Unity bindings do not currently 
support new API changes to allow removal of member from multipoint session


Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call
BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler() no longer implicitly adds a match rule
that allows all globally broadcast signals of the given interface to be received.
Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding, the application developer is
responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch with a rule that
matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.

Starting with version 3.4.0 the AllJoyn daemon and sample programs use a common
shared library called liballjoyn.so on Linux and OpenWrt. In order to run these
programs, you will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to
include the directory where liballjoyn.so is located.

Version 3.4 of the AllJoyn ICE transport changed the hostname for the Rendezvous
server from rdvz.alljoyn.org to connect.alljoyn.org. As a result, pre-3.4 versions
of AllJoyn cannot discover or connect using the ICE transport.
